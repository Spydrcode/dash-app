```json
{
  "action": "ai_insights",
  "timeframe": "all|today|week|month|custom",
  "dateRange": { "start": "YYYY-MM-DD", "end": "YYYY-MM-DD" },
  "includeProjections": true,
  "includeTrends": true
}
```

### Honda Odyssey Specific Calculations

- **Base MPG**: 19 (2003 Honda Odyssey rated efficiency)
- **Fuel Cost**: Distance √∑ Actual MPG √ó Current Gas Price
