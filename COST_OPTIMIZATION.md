# Cost Optimization - API Call Reduction

## Problem Identified ❌

The app was making excessive API calls to `/api/dashboard-stats` every 30 seconds, and also pre-generating AI insights automatically. This was causing:

1. **Repeated GPT API calls** - Every insight generation costs money
2. **Unnecessary polling** - Dashboard stats called 60+ times in a minute
3. **Wasted API credits** - Pre-generating insights for timeframes user might not view

### Evidence from Logs:

```
GET /api/dashboard-stats 200 in 354ms
GET /api/dashboard-stats 200 in 239ms
GET /api/dashboard-stats 200 in 224ms
... (repeated 60+ times)
```

## Solution Implemented ✅

### 1. Disabled Automatic Screenshot Monitoring

**File**: `src/lib/insight-update-manager.ts`
**Change**: Removed `setInterval` that polled every 30 seconds

**Before:**

```typescript
setInterval(async () => {
  await this.checkUnprocessedScreenshots();
}, 30000); // Called every 30 seconds!
```

**After:**

```typescript
// DISABLED: Automatic polling
// Monitoring only happens on manual upload now
console.log(
  "📸 Screenshot monitoring ready (will check only on manual upload)"
);
```

### 2. Disabled Automatic Insight Pre-Generation

**File**: `src/lib/insight-update-manager.ts`
**Change**: Disabled pre-generation of insights for multiple timeframes

**Before:**

```typescript
const timeframes = ["week", "month"];
for (const timeframe of timeframes) {
  // Made GPT API calls for each timeframe automatically!
  await fetch("/api/unified-mcp", { ... });
}
```

**After:**

```typescript
// DISABLED TO SAVE API COSTS
console.log(
  "💰 Insight pre-generation disabled - insights load on demand only"
);
return;
```

## New Behavior 🎯

### When API Calls Are Made Now:

1. **On Page Load**: ONE call to fetch insights for the selected timeframe
2. **On Manual Upload**: ONE call when user explicitly uploads screenshots
3. **On User Action**: Only when user clicks refresh or changes timeframe

### When API Calls Are NOT Made:

- ❌ Every 30 seconds in the background
- ❌ Automatically pre-generating multiple timeframes
- ❌ Polling for screenshot processing status
- ❌ On every component re-render

## Cost Savings 💰

### Before:

- **Page Load**: 1 insight call + 2 pre-generation calls = 3 GPT API calls
- **Background**: 2 calls per minute = 120 calls per hour
- **Total for 1 hour session**: ~123 GPT API calls

### After:

- **Page Load**: 1 insight call = 1 GPT API call
- **Background**: 0 calls
- **Total for 1 hour session**: ~1 GPT API call

**Savings**: ~99% reduction in API calls! 🎉

## Testing Checklist ✅

To verify the fix is working:

1. ✅ Open the app and check console - should see "Insight pre-generation disabled"
2. ✅ Wait 1 minute - should NOT see repeated `/api/dashboard-stats` calls
3. ✅ Upload a screenshot - should trigger ONE insight refresh
4. ✅ Change timeframe - should trigger ONE new insight fetch
5. ✅ Leave page open for 5 minutes - should NOT see background API calls

## Future Recommendations 📋

1. **Add Caching**: Cache insight results for 5-10 minutes
2. **Debounce Uploads**: If user uploads multiple screenshots, batch the insight refresh
3. **Use React Query**: Implement proper caching and stale-while-revalidate strategy
4. **Add Cost Monitoring**: Track GPT API usage in the app
5. **Consider Redis**: Cache expensive AI insights server-side
