# 🎉 ERR_NGROK_8012 PERMANENTLY FIXED!

✅ ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED:
IPv6 vs IPv4 binding conflict between Next.js and ngrok

✅ SOLUTION THAT WORKED:

1.  ✅ Stopped conflicting processes
2.  ✅ Started Next.js with explicit host binding: `npx next dev -H 0.0.0.0 -p 3000`
3.  ✅ Started ngrok with IPv4 explicit binding: `ngrok http 127.0.0.1:3000`

🔧 TECHNICAL FIX DETAILS:

- Next.js was binding to IPv6 [::1]:3000
